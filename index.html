								<h2>Using genomic tools to understand the evolutionary <br />
								responses of hosts and diseases to the rapidly changing environment</h2>
								<p>As a member of the <a href="http://blog.uvm.edu/mpespeni/home/">Pespeni Lab</a>, I'm interested in understanding how species 
								populations will persist through future anthropogenic environmental changes. 
								Specifically, I want to understand how host/disease dynamics will evolve through these changes.
								The system we use to explore our questions are echinoderms and their microbiome and virome in 
								the rocky intertidal marine ecosystem. </p>

								<h3>How and why do large epidemics happen?</h3>
								<p>"Sea star wasting" refers to a wildlife disease epidemic event in sea stars on the 
								West Coast of North America (summer 2013-present). Likely the largest and most dramatic 
								wildlife disease epidemic event recorded, sea star wasting provides an important and unique 
								opportunity to study disease dynamics through an extremely virulent disease epidemic.</p>

								<h3>Can species evolve fast enough to persist in a rapidly changing environment?</h3>
								<p>Sea urchin larvae are highly sensitive to differences in temperature and ocean chemistry and 
								provide insight to the impacts of anthropogenic environmental change such as increased ocean temperature
								and acidity. Results from our work indicate that, selection acts on purple urchin larvae kept in 
								conditions of varying acidity and those kept in more acidic water suffer loses in genetic diversity. 
								We want to expand these results to understand how temperature and disease will play a role in a multiple stressor experiment. </p>
