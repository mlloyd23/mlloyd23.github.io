	<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>Large infectious disease outbreaks 
	allow for relatively faster evolutionary changes in the host, pathogenic agent, and the community of microorganisms 
	living within the host (the microbiome). While these interactions are poorly understood, they’re extremely important 
	in predicting and controlling future outbreaks. The largest recorded marine epidemic is currently ongoing in intertidal 
	ecosystems along the west coast of North America. Sea star wasting disease (SSWD) is effecting sea star populations 
	from South Eastern Alaska to Baja California, Mexico and local extinctions are a serious concern. Large-scale 
	epidemics such as these are expected to become more common as the global climate and species’ population distributions 
	change due to human impacts. This current disease event provides a unique opportunity to better understand how hosts, 
	the host's microbiome, and the disease causing pathogen change throughout an epidemic. The research proposed here will 
	lead to a deeper understanding of these disease events from an evolutionary and ecological perspective by characterizing 
	changes in host and virus due to natural selection following epidemics and comparing genotype and phenotype differences 
	within the host, pathogen, and microbiome. </p>
	
	<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>This project aims to understand 
	the impact of microbiomes and viromes on an individual and in an ecosystem, contributing to our understanding 
	of an organism as a sum of its inhabitants. Traditionally, disease has been understood to be caused by the 
	proliferation of one pathogenic agent within a host. It is becoming clear that a disease event is not just 
	the proliferation of one disease-causing agent but the disruption in the balance within the organisms’ 
	complex community of microorganisms. The evolution of disease is not the coevolution of two players (host and pathogen),
	but the coevolution of all members of the host’s community. The ongoing Sea Star Wasting Disease event provides a 
	unique opportunity to investigate how this evolution plays out in a widespread epidemic caused by a highly 
	virulent agent. Specifically, the proposed research aims to (1) identify genetic signals of natural selection 
	in host and virus populations to identify genomic regions under selection and asses the current state of host 
	disease resistance,and (2) investigate molecular mechanisms of the host, virus, and microbiome that underline 
	resistance in hosts and virulence in virus in order to identify the tipping point between asymptomatic and 
	symptomatic hosts. </p>
